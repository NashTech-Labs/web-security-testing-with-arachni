# 🔒 Security Testing Workflow

This repository provides a GitHub Actions-based **Security Testing Pipeline** designed to scan web applications for vulnerabilities using **Arachni**, an open-source web security scanner. The workflow includes support for scanning any given web URL and comes pre-configured with the **OWASP Juice Shop**—a deliberately insecure application used for demonstrating and validating the scanning process.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This **TechHub** serves as a reusable security testing automation template for DevSecOps and QA teams. It helps teams:

- Integrate automated security scans into CI/CD pipelines
- Perform **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)** using Arachni
- Trigger scans on code changes or on-demand via GitHub UI
- Generate and upload detailed HTML vulnerability reports as workflow artifacts

The template is ideal for:
- Security testing during development
- CI pipeline hardening
- Vulnerability monitoring of internal or external web apps

---

## 🚀 Workflow Overview

The GitHub Actions workflow is triggered on the following events:

- **Push to the `master` branch**
- **Pull request targeting the `master` branch**
- **Manual dispatch via the GitHub Actions UI**

---

## ⚙️ Workflow Steps

The pipeline performs the following actions:

1. **Checkout Repository**  
   Clones your code for access within the workflow.

2. **Set up Docker Buildx** *(conditional)*  
   Prepares Docker for advanced image operations when testing the default local instance.

3. **Pull Juice Shop Image** *(conditional)*  
   Retrieves the vulnerable OWASP Juice Shop Docker image.

4. **Run Juice Shop Container** *(conditional)*  
   Launches Juice Shop locally on port 3000.

5. **Get Container IP** *(conditional)*  
   Extracts the internal IP address of the Juice Shop container.

6. **Wait for App Readiness** *(conditional)*  
   Pings the service until it becomes available.

7. **Download Arachni**  
   Retrieves and extracts the Arachni scanner binaries.

8. **Run Arachni Scan**  
   Scans the target URL (user-specified or default Juice Shop).

9. **List Arachni Output Directory**  
   Shows the generated HTML scan report directory.

10. **Upload HTML Report**  
    Uploads the vulnerability scan report as an artifact to GitHub Actions.

## 📝 Inputs (Manual Dispatch)

| Name | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `url` | URL of the website to scan | `http://localhost:3000` |

---

## 🌍 Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DEFAULT_URL` | Default local test target (`http://localhost:3000`) |

---

## 📦 Artifact Generated

- **Arachni HTML Report**: A detailed vulnerability scan result in HTML format, downloadable from the workflow run summary.

---

## 🛠️ How to Run the Workflow Manually

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository.
2. Click on the **Security Testing** workflow.
3. Press **Run workflow** (top-right).
4. Optionally enter a `url` to scan (leave empty to use the default).
5. Click **Run workflow** again to trigger it.

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

- **No real applications or sensitive data** are committed or scanned.
- Always ensure that scanning is authorized for non-local environments.
- Use test environments for scanning external URLs.

# 📄 How to View the Arachni HTML Report

This guide explains how to download, extract, and view the HTML report generated by [Arachni](https://github.com/Arachni/arachni) — an open-source web application security scanner — as part of your GitHub Actions security testing workflow.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- A completed GitHub Actions workflow run that includes the **Arachni HTML Report** as an artifact
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- A ZIP file extraction tool (e.g., WinRAR, 7-Zip, or built-in system extractor)

---

## 📥 Step 1: Download the Artifact

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Actions** tab.
3. Open the workflow run labeled **Security Testing** or similar.
4. Scroll down to the **Artifacts** section at the bottom of the run summary.
5. Click on the artifact named `arachni-html-report` to download it as a `.zip` file.

---

## 📂 Step 2: Extract the ZIP File

1. Use any archive tool to extract the downloaded ZIP file.
2. You should see a folder structure similar to the following:
arachni-html-report/
└── 2025-07-10 11_57_54 +0000.html/
    └── css/
    ├── fonts/
    ├── index.html/
    └── js/
---
## 🌐 Step 3: Open the HTML Report

1. Open the folder with the `.html` timestamped name (e.g., `2025-07-10 11_57_54 +0000.html/`).
2. Inside it, locate the file named `index.html`.
3. Double-click `index.html` to open it in your default web browser, or:
   - Right-click → **Open with** → select your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

---

## 🧾 What You'll See

- A full summary of vulnerabilities found during the scan
- Vulnerability types (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS)
- Severity ratings (High, Medium, Low)
- Recommendations for remediation
- A clean, navigable interface with filtering options

---

## ✅ Done!

You’ve now successfully viewed your **Arachni vulnerability scan report**.
